            Before we really get into the guide on how to contribute with code, we want you to know a few things:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-4 ml-4 list-inside list-decimal">
            <li>All codes need to follow the <a href="https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/" class="underline" target="_blank">PSR12</a></li>
            <li>All codes need to pass in Laravel Pint & PhpStan validations</li>
            <li>All codes need to pass in <a href="https://pestphp.com/docs/type-coverage" target="_blank" class="underline">Pest Type Coverage</a></li>
            <li>All codes need to be tested with <a href="https://pestphp.com" target="_blank" class="underline">Pest</a></li>
        </ul>
    </x-section>
    <x-section title="Prepare Environment" disable-copy>
        <p>Let's prepare your environment for your first contribution:</p>
        <p class="mt-2">1. Fork the <a href="https://github.com/tallstackui/tallstackui" class="underline" target="_blank">repository</a></p>
        <p>2. Clone the repository forked for your computer.</p>
        <p>3. Create a basic Laravel project using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/starter-kits#laravel-breeze" class="underline" target="_blank">Laravel Breeze</a> with <b>Livewire (V3)</b> stack.</p>
        <p>4. Prepare any authentication way to access the <x-block>/dashboard</x-block></p>
        <p>5. Create a folder in the root of the Laravel project called <x-block>packages</x-block></p>
        <p>6. Inside the <x-block>packages</x-block> folder create another folder called <x-block>tallstackui</x-block></p>
        <p>7. Inside the <x-block>tallstackui</x-block> folder create a symbolic link to the repository forked at your computer:</p>
        <x-code language="shell" :contents="$link" />
        <p>9. The expected folder structure should be: <x-block>packages/tallstackui/tallstackui</x-block></p>
        <p>10. Open the <x-block>composer.json</x-block> of the Laravel project and insert the following content:</p>
        <x-code language="json" :contents="$composer" disable-copy />
        <p>11. In the same <x-block>composer.json</x-block> file, change the <x-block>minimum-stability</x-block> to <x-block>dev</x-block></p>
        <p>12. After that, run the following command in the terminal:</p>
        <x-code language="shell" :contents="$command" />
        <p>13. <a href="{{ route('documentation.installation') }}" class="underline">Install the TallStackUI</a> in the Laravel project following the guide <i class="font-bold">(skip the step 1 of the tutorial)</i></p>
        <p>14. You are ready to start the work!</p>

    <x-section title="Dusk Tests" disable-copy>
        <p>
            Some of the TallStackUI tests are written using <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/dusk" class="underline" target="_blank">Laravel Dusk</a>
            through the <a href="https://github.com/orchestral/testbench-dusk" class="underline" target="_blank">Orchestral Testbench Dusk.</a>
            Although sometimes difficult, you can run the browser tests on your computer. To do this, it is essential
            to have Chrome installed. Use the commands below to prepare your environment.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">Installing the appropriate Chrome driver according to your Chrome version:</p>
        <x-code language="shell" :contents="$dusk" />
        <p class="mt-2">Alternatively, you can use:</p>
        <x-code language="shell" :contents="$alternative" />
    </x-section>
    <x-section title="Run Tests" disable-copy>
        <p>1. Run all tests:</p>
        <x-code language="shell" :contents="$allTests" />
        <p>2. Run only the Feature tests:</p>
        <x-code language="shell" :contents="$feature" />
        <p>3. Run only the Browser tests:</p>
        <x-code language="shell" :contents="$browser" />
        <p>4. Fixing Code Style:</p>
        <x-code language="shell" :contents="$pint" />
        <p>5. Validate Type Coverage & PhpStan:</p>
        <x-code language="shell" :contents="$analyse" />
    </x-section>
    <x-section title="Synchronize Changes" disable-copy>
        <p>
            Sometimes you can make changes to components, but the change is not noticed, it is
            like a cache state in the Laravel project. If this is the case,
            use the instruction below to synchronize the changes:
        </p>
        <x-code language="shell" :contents="$synchronize" />
        <x-warning>
            We suggest you to create an alias to facilitate the execution of this command.
        </x-warning>
